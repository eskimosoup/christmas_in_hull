This is made possible through the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.snowandlights.com/index.html" target="_blank">Snow and Lights</a>&nbsp;community art project, created by contemporary artist Arran Todd.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Join thousands of other spectators for the exciting countdown at 6:50pm, an essential part of Christmas in Hull that we can all share together.</p>

    - |-
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Hull is searching for its&nbsp;Busk Idol for 2011/12. If you busk or have thought of busking then this competition is for you.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">There&rsquo;s the chance to perform at the Christmas Lights Switch-on,&nbsp;Thursday 24<sup>th</sup> November, and at the Freedom Festival in 2012, as well as busk at one of our five Busk Stops on Thursdays and Saturdays on the run up to Christmas.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Working in partnership, Hull City Council, Hull BID, Viking FM, Magic 1161 and the Hull Daily Mail are looking to showcase the region's best talent this Christmas, adding to the fun and lively experience created by all the partners who are putting on events and activities for Christmas in Hull.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The&nbsp;five Busk Stops will complement other Christmas activities stretching from the Interchange to Trinity Square as part of the bid to drive footfall across the City Centre: Transport Interchange, King Edward Street, Monument Bridge, Parliament Street/Whitefriargate and Trinity Square.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Councillor Terry Geraghty, Portfolio Holder for Culture and Leisure, said: &ldquo;Busk Idol offers a chance for entertainers of all types to compete to perform in front of crowds at the Christmas Lights Switch-on, as well as showcasing the city&rsquo;s busking talent at five busk stops in the city centre on the weekends and late night shopping evenings on the run up to Christmas.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">"The performers will&nbsp;complement the Christmas in Hull activity put together by Hull BID, which is further complemented by other partners and shopping centres, to offer lively and fun festive shopping experiences in the city for businesses, residents and visitors.&rdquo;</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you&rsquo;re a singer, juggler, street dancer or any other kind of street entertainer, we want to hear from you.&nbsp; 96.9 Viking FM Breakfast Show host, Paul Foster, said: &ldquo;The great thing about this competition is that it&rsquo;s not just for musicians; we&rsquo;re keen to have all aspects of street performance represented and the prize offers a platform for great exposure for the winner!&rdquo;<br /> <br /> If you are a busker new or old you can get involved by registering for the heats at <a href="http://www.vikingfm.co.uk/buskidol">www.vikingfm.co.uk/buskidol</a> before midday Friday 18 November. Heats take place in the form of live busking at the Paragon Transport Interchange in Hull on Sunday 20<sup> </sup>November.</p>

    - You think you know the story, do you? Old man leaves out leather, elves turn it into shoes in the night? You haven't heard the half of it. What about the elves? What are they doing making shoes? Why aren't they making toys for&nbsp; Santa&nbsp;like normal elves?

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Fun for all sizes! Ages 4 and up.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">You think you know the story, do you? Old man leaves out leather, elves turn it into shoes in the night? You haven't heard the half of it. What about the elves? What are they doing making shoes? Why aren't they making toys for Santa&nbsp;like normal elves?<br /><br />And what happens when the shoemaker's wife fancies owning her own personal magic elf?</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">This&nbsp;Christmas, join Corky and Peeptoe, the weirdest elves nobody has ever met, and hear a side of the&nbsp;classic&nbsp;fairytale you have never heard before.<br /><br />A cast of hundreds, played by two elves (and a variety of shoes), will take you on a journey you're not going to forget in a hurry. The songs will be silly, the jokes will be... jokey - and it may even change the way you think about flip-flops.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Matinees every Wednesday and Saturday at 2:30pm (except 17th December).</strong></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><br /></strong></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The hilarious and&nbsp;touching comedy&nbsp;of Christmas misunderstandings by the writer of&nbsp;Calendar&nbsp;Girls&nbsp;- all about what happens when you're not playing Mary.&nbsp;<br /><br />The same actors play both children and their&nbsp;uncannily&nbsp;similar parents, as we join the infants class at Flint Street School preparing for their first nativity performance. The Virgin Mary has a fierce competitor in the&nbsp;spiteful Angel Gabriel, Wise Man Frankincense is verbally challenged by a lisp, Herod rages like a footballer brutally brought down mid-match and the Innkeeper behaves like a psychopath. To crown it all, baby Jesus' head has fallen off. Fretting about their offspring's impending public performance, the adults row rage and&nbsp;obsess&nbsp;just like their children, to hilarious effect. Whilst the clothes may change, the foibles are all too similar...!</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">An&nbsp;uplifting, fast-paced comedy which reminds us that, even as adults, we're never too far away from being children. Joyful, daft, and&nbsp;deeply Christmassy, this is a heartwarmingly funny play. Based on&nbsp;Tim Firth's&nbsp;own hit TV comedy, which starred&nbsp;Jane Horrocks,&nbsp;Stephen Tompkinson,&nbsp;Neil Morrissey&nbsp;and&nbsp;Josie Lawrence.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Hull Truck's grown-up seasonal treat is perfect for adults - and the child in all of us.</p>

      <p>Two-time Grammy award nominee&nbsp;Tommy Emmanuel&nbsp;will come to Hull City Hall on&nbsp;Thursday 1st December&nbsp;as part of his 50th anniversary world tour.</p>
      <p>This legendary guitarist is one of Australia&rsquo;s most respected musicians. Tommy's unique style - he calls it simply &lsquo;finger style&rsquo; - is akin to playing guitar the way a pianist plays piano, using all ten fingers. Rather than using a whole band for melody, rhythm, bass, and drum parts, Tommy plays it all - and more &ndash; on just one guitar.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel's unusually broad repertoire encompasses not only country and bluegrass, but pop, jazz, blues, gospel, even classical, flamenco, and aboriginal styles. His technical precision and his virtuosic improvisations make this performance a must see for all fans of guitar-based music.</p>
      <p>Throughout his career, Tommy has picked up numerous awards for his unique and innovative musical style. In 2009 Tommy was honored with Guitar Player Magazine's most prestigious annual Guitar Legend Award, as well as being named Thumb-picker of the Year for the second time.&nbsp; Most recently, Guitar Players 2010 Readers Choice Awards named him Best Acoustic Guitarist for the second time.</p>

      <p>Kate Rusby is steeped in her local traditions and tonight showcases the carols and songs learnt through childhood in her native South Yorkshire. Come along to hear new variations of familiar carols mostly unheard outside the area.</p>
      <p>This un-missable evening follows the release of Kate&rsquo;s 2nd album of Yorkshire-inspired songs and carols in November 2011 and Kate is touring with her band, complete with brass quintet - a rousing Christmas celebration!</p>
      <p>The defining voice of contemporary English folk music, Kate Rusby&rsquo;s exquisite interpretations of traditional songs and finely wrought self-penned tunes have won her an audience that reaches beyond the genre. A rare achievement for a folk artist but entirely understandable given Rusby&rsquo;s expressive vocals that invest whatever she sings with irresistible emotional depth.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">Put the 24th November on your calendar and make sure to wrap-up warm, because it's time for the biggest public event of Christmas 2011!</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Take part in <strong>craft workshops</strong> in Ferens Art Gallery and Queen Victoria Square from 4pm and enjoy the live&nbsp;<strong>musical entertainment</strong>&nbsp;outside Hull City Hall from 5pm.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Follow the&nbsp;<strong>Santa Parade</strong>&nbsp;as it leaves Holy Trinity at 6pm and makes its jolly way to Queen Victoria Square via Whitefriargate.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The facade of Ferens Art Gallery transforms into a work of art in itself, with <strong>projected snowflakes</strong> giving it the magical appearance of a gigantic snowglobe. This is made possible through the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.snowandlights.com/index.html" target="_blank">Snow and Lights</a>&nbsp;community art project, created by contemporary artist Arran Todd.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cheer on Santa</strong> as he abseils down City Hall at 6:30pm before joining thousands of other spectators for the <strong>exciting countdown</strong> at 6:50pm, an essential part of Christmas in Hull that we can all share together.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">As the nights become darker, everyone can bask in the heartwarming glow and celebratory atmosphere of a traditional Christmas throughout Hull City Centre.</p>

23/12/10
--------
Carl - Changed TinyMCE so that it works properly with IE. If you need to fix this in old sites copy accross
       the public/javascripts/admin/tiny_mce_config.js file and insert.html.erb files from eskimo_images,
       eskimo_links and eskimo_documents.

Nick - Changed the default admin page node index views to account for sites which cant add new pages and tweaked tree_select to not select a disabled option by default.

24/11/10
--------
Nick - Added code to the /app/controller/admin/page_nodes_controller.rb in the branch method to allow files to copy when a page contents is duplicated.  To allow this you will need to add a on a site for site basis, not just copying over the plugins.
Nick - took out the default behaviour of using the stylesheet named in the style of the page node.  Hannah never uses this so its a bit pointless.
Nick - changed the page_node can be moved select tag so that souper admins can always move page nodes and so "top level insertion" (...) is on by default.

--------
Nick - added a new helper: number helper, at the moment just has the number_to_pounds method but this is where we will dump all other number methods.
Nick - added quick_fill_tag to form helper in eskimagic.  This inserts a select box which prefils a target element.  e.g. quick_fill_tag("product_colour", Product.all.collect{|x| x.colour}.uniq.sort, name="Similar Colours...") will fill the products colour with the colour the person selects from the drop down menu, which will be full of other colours which products use.  
Carl - Removed html_popups routes from config/routes. Also sorted out the rest of the routes so the fallback catch-all routes we usually have should be unnecessary. So I commented them out.


16/11/10
--------
Nick - Added a Users generator to eskimo_generators and upped to version 0.0.2.  
Nick - Titles in the navigation partial are now links at hannahs request.  Also stripped an old reference to the g method from search  results page.

15/11/10
--------
Carl - updated documents so they work with tiny mce like images. See README in plugin for details. Also there is an integration guide for sites made in the last few days.
Nick - small changes, made the tree select check that the items in it havn;t been recycled (mostly for page notes, position select).  Also changed the default data so the feature "Recycle Bin" goes to the controller "admin/extra_infos" to stop a problem with routes.


11/11/10
--------
Nick - Turned off error messages by default since they are sometimes getting to the client, we are so overloaded with them that it makes it impossible to check.  We can turn them on when we need to if we have a known issue on a site or just plain do want it on.
Nick - Fixed a bug in eskimagic where the creator and updater werent getting set.  Also change the index_list_advanced to list the creator and updater properly and removed delete page links from index_list and index_list_advanced.
Nick - Moved the generators from lib and eskimagic into a generic eskimo_generators controller so we can more easily update the generators in various sites.
Adam - Altered contact us mailer view from '...has filled in the contact us a question form' to '...has filled in the contact us form'.


10/11/10
--------
Nick - Fixed a bug in the PageNode versioning where a version in the recycle bin would still show up in the versions navigation.


10/11/10
--------
Carl - Replaced old document management with new paperclip style like the current image management. Usage and syntax should be eerily familiar. See the Readme. Raised version number.


====== VERSION=1.0.2=RELEASED ======


10/11/10
--------
Adam - Altered contact us mailer subject to include 'Site Name'.
Nick - Tiny change on the eskimo_scaffold so that the name of the feature generated by running the scaffold is .titlized instead of .humanized.


9/11/10
-------

04/11/10
--------
Nick - Added display_in_navigation option back into page nodes for a more specific hide option (to hide from navigation but display on site map)


28/10/10
--------
Carl - Dropped in the eskimo_tables plugin which moves the code from the admin_table_helper in eskimagic to tables/eskimo_table in the new plugin. admin_table can be used in the same way it was being used. eskimo_table can be passed :manual_sorting => true to switch to one like the old "admin/shared/admin_table_sort". Apart from that it's still the same so far.


27/10/10
--------
Carl - Dropped in the subscribes_to plugin from arena


27/10/10
--------
Nick - Added generators for Articles, Events, Case Studies, FAQs, Testimonials and XImages (located in lib/generators)
Nick - Moved tasks from eskimagic, eskimo_images and yaml_db to lib folder to remove warning
Nick - Added code to automatically format dates and date times in the admin tables
Nick - Moved the paperclip tasks to lib/tasks to force them to work, this is a bad approach and needs to be addressed


21/10/10
--------
Carl - Added conditional to path method of PageNode model that checks for controller with no action. Added similar path method to Feature model. Changed some methods in web/_left_navigation to use these methods.
Carl - Added quite a few routes to the standard, eskimodules and eskimages route files.
